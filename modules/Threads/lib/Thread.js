/**
 * # Decaf Threads Module
 *
 * Decaf provides an API for spawning and manipulating JavaScript running in JVM threads.  Think of these as
 * true JavaScript threads.
 *
 * By default, a Decaf application has just one thread, the "main" thread.  If you spawn additional threads,
 * they share the global address space with the main thread and each other.  This means they can access the
 * same global variables, call the same functions, and so on.
 *
 * Hannes WallnÃ¶fer wrote a great article about how Threaded JavaScript works here:
 * - http://hns.github.io/2011/05/12/threads.html
 *
 * Using Decaf Threads is trivial:
 *
 * ```javascript
 * var Thread = require('Threads').Thread;
 *
 * var myThread = new Thread(function() {
 *      while (!Thread.interrupted()) {
 *          Thread.sleep(1);
 *          console.log('Thread alive');
 *      }
 *  });
 *
 *  myThread.start();
 *  // myThread is now running and printing "Thread alive" every second.
 *
 *  // let's let it run for 10 seconds
 *  Thread.sleep(10);
 *
 * // Now let's interrupt it (it will exit its while loop)
 * myThread.interrupt();
 * ```
 *
 * ### Observable Threads
 *
 * Decaf Thread instances are observable.  That is, they support event listeners and firing arbitrary events per thread.
 *
 * WHen a Thread exits, an "exit" event will be fired on the thread instance.  You might use this to spawn a new thread to replace the one that is exiting.
 *
 * You may listen on any other events by name and fire those on the thread instance as well.
 *
 * ### Thread instance "this"
 *
 * Each Thread instance has a "this" that points at an object with Thread local information.  You may store thread local data on the "this.data" object if you choose.
 *
 * In fact, many of the Decaf modules (add ons, repositories) store per-thread data on the "this" per thread.
 *
 * ### Passing arguments to Threads
 *
 * The Decaf implementation of Threads allows you to specify arguments to be passed to your Thread function.
 *
 * ```javascript
 * var Thread = require('Threads').Thread;
 *
 * var myThread = new Thread(function(a, b, c) {
 *    this.on('exit', function() {
 *        console.log('myThread exited');
 *    });
 *    console.log('a = ' + a);
 *    console.log('b = ' + b);
 *    console.log('c = ' + c);
 * }, 1, 2, 3);
 *
 * myThread.start();
 * // => a = 1
 * // => b = 2
 * // => c = 3
 * // and myThread exits:
 * // => myThread exited
 * ```

 * ## new Thread(fn, ...arguments) : Thread

 * - fn {function} - the function to be run in a new JVM thread
 * - ...arguments - optional arguments that will be passed to the function when the thread is started

 * ### Returns:
 * - A reference to the "this" object for the new Thread.

 * var thread = new Thread(myThreadFunction);
 * ```
 *
 * @class Thread
 * @param {Function} fn - function to run as thread
